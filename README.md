# RSA Cryptography Utility

This program provides cryptographic functionalities, including primality testing, large prime generation, and RSA-like key pair generation.

- **Prime Number Check**: Determines whether a given integer is prime.
- **Custom Bit-Size Prime Generation**: Generates a large prime number based on a user-defined bit size.
- **RSA Key Pair Generation**: Creates an RSA-like key pair using two large prime numbers.
- **User-Friendly Menu**: Allows easy selection of cryptographic functions.
- **Efficient Prime Testing**: Uses an optimized algorithm for determining primality.
